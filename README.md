# DNA-Hybrid Crypto-Benchmark

This repository contains the official source code and benchmarking framework for the research paper:

**"A Secure and Compact Hybrid Encryption Model Combining Adaptive Compression, AES, and DNA-Inspired Key Generation"** by Yusra Al-Najjar, Raghad Abed, and Abdulla Al-Ali.

The project implements a novel hybrid encryption model that integrates adaptive GZIP compression, DNA-based key generation, and AES-CTR encryption to achieve superior storage efficiency without compromising security. This framework allows for the performance benchmarking and security analysis of this proposed method against seven other established encryption algorithms.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Hybrid Encryption Model:** Implements the proposed method combining adaptive compression, DNA-based key generation, and AES-CTR encryption.
*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Tests 8 encryption algorithms on various file types.
*   **Security Analysis:** Performs statistical tests (NIST SP 800-22) and calculates avalanche effect and entropy.
*   **Conditional Compression:** Intelligently applies GZIP compression only when it reduces overall size.
*   **DNA Cryptography:** Utilizes a nucleotide-to-binary mapping (A=00, C=01, G=10, T=11) for secure key generation.
*   **Extensible Framework:** Easily modifiable to add new algorithms or metrics.

## üî¢ Implemented Algorithms

The framework benchmarks the following encryption methods:

1.  **Symmetric Block Ciphers:**
    *   `AES-128` (CBC mode)
    *   `DES` (CBC mode)
    *   `Blowfish` (using AES as a reference implementation)
2.  **Symmetric Stream Cipher:**
    *   `ChaCha20`
3.  **One-Time Pads:**
    *   `OTP` (Standard One-Time Pad)
    *   `DNA-OTP` (DNA-based One-Time Pad)
4.  **Compression Hybrid:**
    *   `AES-128+GZIP` (Compress then encrypt)
5.  **Proposed Method:**
    *   `Proposed` (Adaptive Compression + DNA-AES-CTR)

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Performance Benchmarking

This script measures encryption/decryption time, throughput, ciphertext size, and expansion ratio.

```bash
python benchmark.py
python security_analysis.py
Input: Generates random data for analysis.

Output: Results are saved to comprehensive_security_analysis.csv.

Metrics: Shannon Entropy, Avalanche Effect (%), Monobit Test (p-value), Byte Distribution Test (p-value), Runs Test (p-value).
